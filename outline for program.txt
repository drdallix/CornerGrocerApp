Class Item:
    - create a private variable named "ItemMap" to store the frequency of items as a dictionary
    
    - create a constructor method that takes in a file name as a parameter
      - open the file with the given name
      - read the contents of the file line by line
      - for each line, split it into individual items
      - for each item, increase its count in the ItemMap dictionary
      - close the file
    
    - create a public method named "SearchItem" that takes in an item as a parameter
      - check if the item is in the ItemMap dictionary
      - if the item is in the dictionary, return its frequency
      - otherwise, return "Item not found"
      
    - create a public method named "PrintFrequencyList"
      - iterate through the ItemMap dictionary and print each item and its frequency
      
    - create a public method named "PrintHistogram"
      - iterate through the ItemMap dictionary
      - for each item, print the item followed by a number of asterisks equal to its frequency
      
    - create a public method named "WriteBackup" that takes in a file name as a parameter
      - open a file with the given name
      - write the frequency of all items in the ItemMap dictionary to the file
      - close the file
      

Class Menu: 
    - create a loop to display a menu to the user with the following options:
        1. Search for a specific item
        2. Print a list with the frequency of all items
        3. Print a histogram of the frequency of all items
        4. Exit program
      - prompt the user to select an option
      - based on the user's selection, call the appropriate method from the Item class
	- use a try catch loop to catch cin input exception if user inputs something invalid
      - repeat the loop until the user selects the "Exit program" option

Main Class:
    - create an instance of the Item class with the input file name "CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt"
    - call the "WriteBackup" method with the file name "frequency.dat"
    - call Menu(Item) to start menu loop
